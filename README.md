# W3 UI

W3 UI is a set of Web components for <a href="http://www.blazor.net/">Blazor</a>, based on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp">How To</a> tutorials.

The components have been implemented with Razor, C# and SCSS.

This project is not affiliated with W3Schools.

## Install

```sh
$ dotnet add package W3.UI --version 0.1.0-*
```

## Goal

The goal is to provide a basic set of components, based on the W3Schools CSS styles, to be used when building web apps using Blazor.

## Strategy
Implement components in Razor and C#, and avoid the use of JavaScript.

Port stylesheets to SCSS.
